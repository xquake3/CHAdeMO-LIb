When there is a property with the same name in microcontroller tool, the value of this property synchronizes with it.This is common to all the build modes.
 PIC/PID

In PIC, the default section for functions is changed to ".pctext". In PIROD, the default section for const data is changed to ".pcconst32". By specifying this option, since these sections are accessed by PC-relative, sections can be located at a desired address after linkage.This option corresponds to the -pic option and -pirod option of the ccrh command.
                                          Enable PID function                                                               No                                                                                                                                             Specifies whether to enable the PID (position independent data) function. In PID, the default section for initialized data is changed to ".sdata" and the default section for uninitialized data is changed to ".sbss32". By specifying this option, since all access to these sections are done by GP-relative or EP-relative, sections can be located at a desired address after linkage.This option corresponds to the -pid option of the ccrh command.

                                          ep-register treatment                                                             Treat as callee-save(No option specified)                                                                                                      Specifies the treatment of the ep-register. Select "Fix in project(-Xep=fix)" when following status strings are wrote in #pragma section.Status strings: ep_auto, ep_disp4, ep_disp5, ep_disp7, ep_disp8, ep_disp16, ep_disp23If "-Omap" or "-Osmap" is specified, the selection is "Treat as callee-save(No option specified)" only.This option corresponds to the -Xep option of the ccrh command.
